Learning how to Origin
==========================

Origin is a library mod, commonly used for TheTemportalist's mods. It relies on MinecraftForge, and provides an API and/or a foundation for creating mods, as well as encompassing an internal mod and addon mods.
That said, you are welcome to use it as the basis of your own mods!
